Here's a complete, ready-to-use blueprint to build your own platform-independent version of a Solitaire Cash-style game (call it Solitaire Royale or Cashless Solitaire). Everything is designed for unlimited fake currency (“Coins”), no real gambling, same-deck fairness, 5-minute timed matches, and competitive leaderboards.1. Software Design Document (SDD) – High-Level OverviewProject Name: Solitaire Royale
Version: 1.0
Goal: A skill-based, multiplayer Klondike Solitaire (3-card draw) with timed 5-minute matches, identical decks for all players, points for moves + big time bonus, and a fake-currency economy (unlimited Coins).Core FeaturesSingle-player practice (unlimited time or timed)
Multiplayer tournaments (2–8 players, same deck)
5-minute countdown
Scoring: base points + time bonus
Leaderboard per match → 1st/2nd/3rd (sometimes 4th) get Coin prizes
Fake economy: free daily coins, entry fees (10–100 Coins), big prize pools
Progression: XP levels, daily streaks, “Clubs” (optional later)
Cross-platform: Web, iOS, Android, Desktop (one codebase)

Non-Goals
Real money, ads, limited redeals, bots in cash tournaments.2. Game Rules & Scoring (Solitaire Cash style)Rules (Turn-3 Klondike – unlimited redeals)Same as the Klondike rules I gave you earlier, with 3-card draw.
Unlimited passes through the stock.
You may move cards back from foundation to tableau.
Game ends automatically at 5:00 or when you tap “Finish” (if no moves left or you solved it).

Scoring System (exact numbers copied from real Solitaire Cash for authenticity)Moving any card to a foundation → +100 points
Moving a card within the tableau (or waste → tableau) that uncovers a new face-down card → +20 points
Full solve (all 52 cards in foundations) → base score includes the 5,200 from foundations
Reshuffle (when stock runs out) → –20 points (only once per cycle if you want to penalize spam)
Undo → –points equal to the last move (or just disable undo in competitive mode)

Time Bonus (huge incentive to finish fast)
Time Bonus = Base Score × (Time Remaining / 300)
Example: Base 6,000, finish in 1:30 (90 s remaining) → bonus = 6,000 × 90/300 = +1,800
Total score = 7,800Final Score = Base + Time Bonus
If you “Exit” early when stuck → still get time bonus (encourages clean finish).Match OutcomeAll players get the exact same deck (seeded shuffle)
Highest final score wins
Prize distribution example (8-player match, 50-coin entry):1st: 200 coins
2nd: 100 coins
3rd: 50 coins
4th: 20 coins (sometimes)
Rest: 0

3. Architecture SpecificationHigh-level Architecture (Client-Server, real-time)

Clients (React/Web, React Native, Flutter) 
        ↓ WebSocket / Firebase Realtime
Backend (Firebase or Node + Socket.io)
        ↓
Database (Firestore / MongoDB)

ComponentsGame Engine (Client-side only)Pure JS/TS class: KlondikeGame
Deterministic shuffle from seed
Move validation, animation, undo stack, auto-complete to foundations (optional)

Lobby / Matchmaking ServerCreate/join tournament (choose entry fee)
Skill-based matchmaking (Elo-like or simple bucket by level)
When enough players → generate one seed → broadcast to room

Game RoomReal-time clock sync
Players play independently
At end of 5 min or when player finishes → client submits signed score + proof (move list or final foundation state)
Server validates (optional, for anti-cheat) and ranks

Economy & ProgressionUser profile (Coins, XP, level, daily login streak)
Cloud Functions for prize distribution

Offline ModePractice games stored locally (IndexedDB / AsyncStorage)

Data Flow (Multiplayer Match)Player joins lobby → pays entry fee in Coins
Server waits for N players → picks seed → sends to all clients
Clients load identical board
Timer starts (server-authoritative)
Every 10 s: optional heartbeat of current base score
Player finishes or timer hits 0 → client sends final score
Server calculates prizes → updates balances → shows leaderboard

4. Recommended Tech Stack (Platform-Independent)Option A – Fastest to MVP (Recommended)Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite (web)
→ Wrap with Capacitor → native iOS/Android apps in minutes
→ Or Tauri → desktop apps
UI: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI + react-dnd (drag & drop cards)
Game rendering: HTML/CSS canvas or pure DOM (SVG cards work great)
Backend & Real-time: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Realtime Database)
State: Zustand or Jotai
Seeding: seedrandom library (deterministic shuffle)

Option B – Fully Native FeelFlutter (one codebase for Web + iOS + Android + Desktop)
Firebase or Supabase

Option C – Pure Web + Self-hostedNext.js 15 (App Router)
Socket.io + Node/Express
PostgreSQL + Prisma

5. Ready-to-Copy Prompts for AI Code GenerationPrompt 1 – Core Game Engine

Build a complete TypeScript class `KlondikeGame` for 3-card-draw Klondike Solitaire.
- Accept a seed string → deterministic shuffle (use seedrandom)
- Methods: deal(), drawFromStock(), moveCard(from, to), canAutoMoveToFoundation(), isSolved()
- Return full game state as JSON every move
- Include scoring: +100 to foundation, +20 for uncovering, time bonus formula
- Support multi-card moves and foundation ↔ tableau moves

Prompt 2 – React Game Component

Create a React + TypeScript component for the solitaire board using react-dnd.
- 7 tableau piles, 4 foundations, stock, waste (show top 3 for turn-3)
- Drag & drop single cards or valid sequences
- Click-to-move auto-play logic
- Timer display (5:00 countdown)
- "Finish" button
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid drops

Prompt 3 – Multiplayer Match Room (Firebase)

Using Firebase v10, implement a match room:
- Create tournament with entry fee X coins
- When N players join → generate seed, write to Firestore doc
- Subscribe to timer and final scores
- At end, rank players, distribute coins via transaction

Prompt 4 – Deterministic Deck (shared across clients)

Write a function that takes a seed string and returns a shuffled 52-card deck array in the exact same order on every client. Use seedrandom. Cards as objects {rank, suit}.

Prompt 5 – Full Project Scaffold

Generate a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase starter project structure for a multiplayer Solitaire game with the rules above.

Next Steps for YouStart with the single-player game engine + UI (Prompts 1 & 2) → you’ll have a working solitaire in <2 hours.
Add Firebase auth + simple practice mode.
Then implement the multiplayer lobby (Prompt 3).

You now have everything an AI (me, Claude, GPT, Cursor, etc.) needs to generate the entire app piece by piece.Want me to generate the actual code for the KlondikeGame class right now, or the Firebase matchmaking schema? Just say the word!
